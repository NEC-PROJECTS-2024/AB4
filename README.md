INTRODUCTION

Machine learning has been increasingly applied in identi cation of fraudulent transactions.However, most application systems detect duplicitous activities after they have already occurred, not ator near real time. Since spurious transactions are far fewer than the normal ones, the highly imbalanceddata makes fraud detection very challenging and calls for ways to address it beyond the traditionalmachine learning approach. This study has proposed a detection framework, and implemented it usingquantum machine learning (QML) approach by applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhanced withquantum annealing solvers. To evaluate its detection performance, we have further implemented twelvemachine learning methods, and compared the performance of QML application with these machine learningimplementations on two datasets: Israel credit card transactions (non-time series) which is moderatelyimbalanced, and a bank loan dataset (time series) that is highly imbalanced.
